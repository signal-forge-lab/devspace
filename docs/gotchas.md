# Troubleshooting Gotchas

This page collects the setup issues users are most likely to hit.

## `devspace` Command Not Found

Use `npx`:

```bash
npx @waishnav/devspace init
npx @waishnav/devspace serve
```

If you installed globally, confirm npm's global bin directory is on `PATH`.

## Unsupported Node Version

DevSpace requires Node `>=22.19 <27`.

Check:

```bash
node --version
```

Install Node 22 LTS with your preferred version manager such as `nvm`, `fnm`, or
`mise`.

## `better-sqlite3` Could Not Load

This usually means native dependencies were installed under a different Node
runtime.

Try:

```bash
npm rebuild better-sqlite3
```

Then run:

```bash
npx @waishnav/devspace doctor
```

Release starts run a native dependency check before launching.

## Public URL Includes `/mcp`

Use the origin for setup:

```text
https://your-tunnel-host.example.com
```

Use the MCP endpoint in the client:

```text
https://your-tunnel-host.example.com/mcp
```

If you saved the wrong value:

```bash
npx @waishnav/devspace config set publicBaseUrl https://your-tunnel-host.example.com
```

## Tunnel URL Changed

Temporary tunnels often change URLs between runs.

For a one-off run:

```bash
DEVSPACE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL="https://new-tunnel.example.com" npx @waishnav/devspace serve
```

For a stable URL:

```bash
npx @waishnav/devspace config set publicBaseUrl https://devspace.example.com
```

## Host Header Or 403 Problems

DevSpace derives allowed hosts from the configured public URL.

Run:

```bash
npx @waishnav/devspace doctor
```

Confirm the public URL hostname appears in allowed hosts. If you changed tunnel
URLs, update `publicBaseUrl`.

Use this only for intentional local debugging:

```bash
DEVSPACE_ALLOWED_HOSTS="*" npx @waishnav/devspace serve
```

## OAuth Redirect Host Rejected

By default, DevSpace allows redirects for:

```text
chatgpt.com
localhost
127.0.0.1
```

If another MCP client uses a different redirect host, configure:

```bash
DEVSPACE_OAUTH_ALLOWED_REDIRECT_HOSTS="chatgpt.com,example.com" npx @waishnav/devspace serve
```

## Owner Password Not Accepted

Make sure you are entering the Owner password from:

```text
~/.devspace/auth.json
```

To regenerate setup:

```bash
npx @waishnav/devspace init --force
```

## Unknown `workspaceId`

`workspaceId` values are session identifiers. If the server restarts and the
client receives an unknown workspace error, call `open_workspace` again for that
project.

Workspace session metadata is persisted, but clients should still treat
`open_workspace` as the way to begin a fresh working session.

## Workspace Path Rejected

The path must be inside one of the allowed roots configured during setup.

Run:

```bash
npx @waishnav/devspace config get
```

Then either open a project under an allowed root or rerun setup:

```bash
npx @waishnav/devspace init --force
```

## Worktree Mode Fails

Worktree mode requires:

- Git installed
- the path is inside a Git repository
- the repository has at least one commit
- the requested `baseRef` resolves to a commit

For a new repository, create the first commit or use checkout mode.

Uncommitted source checkout changes are not copied into the managed worktree.
Commit, stash, or ask the model to work in checkout mode if those changes are
needed.

## Windows Shell Commands Fail

The shell requirement depends on the selected tool mode:

- `minimal` and `full` expose the `bash` tool and require Git Bash,
  WSL, MSYS2, Cygwin Bash, or another compatible Bash environment;
- experimental `codex` mode exposes `exec_command` and currently uses the
  Windows command processor from `ComSpec`, normally `cmd.exe`;
- PowerShell is not currently selected automatically for `exec_command`.

Install Git for Windows or use WSL when using a `bash` tool surface. In `codex`
mode, write commands for the active `cmd.exe` syntax unless the implementation
is later configured to use another shell.

The `codex` tool-mode name does not mean that Workbridge launches the local
Codex CLI or inherits a shell choice from Codex.

Run:

```bash
npx @waishnav/devspace doctor
```

Confirm Bash is detected when using a `bash` tool surface. A missing Bash result
does not by itself prevent native Windows `exec_command` use in `codex` mode.

## Skills Do Not Appear

Skills are always enabled. Confirm that the skill has a valid `SKILL.md` and is
in a standard Agent Skills location or a path listed in
`DEVSPACE_SKILL_PATHS`. Legacy project locations such as `.pi/skills` must be
added explicitly.

When `open_workspace` advertises a skill, read its `SKILL.md` before other files
inside that skill directory.
