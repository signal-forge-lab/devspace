# Configuration Reference

DevSpace can be configured through `devspace init`, persisted config files, or
environment variables.

The default files are:

```text
~/.devspace/config.json
~/.devspace/auth.json
```

Use another config directory with:

```bash
DEVSPACE_CONFIG_DIR=/path/to/config npx @waishnav/devspace serve
```

## Commands

```bash
npx @waishnav/devspace init
npx @waishnav/devspace serve
npx @waishnav/devspace doctor
npx @waishnav/devspace config get
npx @waishnav/devspace config set publicBaseUrl https://devspace.example.com
```

## Core Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `HOST` | Local bind host. Defaults to `127.0.0.1`. |
| `PORT` | Local port. Defaults to `7676`. |
| `DEVSPACE_ALLOWED_ROOTS` | Comma-separated local roots that workspaces may open. |
| `DEVSPACE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | Public origin for the server, without `/mcp`. |
| `DEVSPACE_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Optional Host header allowlist override. |
| `DEVSPACE_OAUTH_OWNER_TOKEN` | Owner password for OAuth approval. Must be at least 16 characters. |
| `DEVSPACE_WORKTREE_ROOT` | Directory for managed Git worktrees. Defaults to `~/.devspace/worktrees`. |
| `DEVSPACE_STATE_DIR` | Directory for SQLite state. Defaults to `~/.local/share/devspace`. |

## OAuth

DevSpace uses a single-user OAuth approval flow.

| Variable | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `DEVSPACE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS` | `3600` |
| `DEVSPACE_OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS` | `2592000` |
| `DEVSPACE_OAUTH_SCOPES` | `devspace` |
| `DEVSPACE_OAUTH_ALLOWED_REDIRECT_HOSTS` | `chatgpt.com,localhost,127.0.0.1` |

MCP clients discover metadata from:

```text
/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp
/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server
```

## Tool Modes

`DEVSPACE_TOOL_MODE` controls the tool surface.

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `minimal` | Default. Exposes `open_workspace`, `read`, `write`, `edit`, and `bash`. Clients use `bash` with tools such as `rg`, `find`, and `ls` for inspection. |
| `main` | Stable primary surface. Exposes the minimal tools plus dedicated `grep`, `glob`, and `ls` tools. |
| `full` | Exposes the minimal tools plus dedicated `grep`, `glob`, and `ls` tools. |
| `codex` | Experimental. Exposes `open_workspace`, `read`, `apply_patch`, `exec_command`, and `write_stdin`. Existing mutation and shell tools are hidden. |

`DEVSPACE_MINIMAL_TOOLS` remains a backward-compatible alias when
`DEVSPACE_TOOL_MODE` is unset: `1` selects `minimal` and `0` selects `full`.
The `codex` mode must be selected through `DEVSPACE_TOOL_MODE` and always uses
its fixed short tool names regardless of `DEVSPACE_TOOL_NAMING`.

Codex-mode commands run without a PTY by default. Set `tty: true` on
`exec_command` for interactive terminal programs. PTY support uses the optional
`node-pty` dependency; `write_stdin` can send input, poll output, and resize PTY
sessions.

### Patch consolidation guidance

This section is intentionally named so the guidance can be reverted cleanly if
it makes model behavior worse. Revert commit `feat guide patch consolidation`
or remove this section plus the matching `patchConsolidationInstruction` block
in `src/server.ts`.

In `codex` mode, related file edits should be batched into one `apply_patch`
call per logical implementation step. A single patch may update multiple files
and multiple hunks. Repeated small `apply_patch` calls should be avoided unless
the previous patch failed, the change set is too large to review safely, or the
user explicitly asks for separate checkpoints.

Set `WORKBRIDGE_ENABLE_WORKSPACE_TASKS=1` to expose `launch_workspace_task`.
The launcher accepts only allowlisted workspace tasks. The initial task is
`aegis_runner`, which resolves `aegis_runner.py` inside the opened workspace.
Templates may be defined in `.workbridge/workspace-tasks.json` or in a central
config file set with `WORKBRIDGE_WORKSPACE_TASKS_CONFIG`.

## Widgets

`DEVSPACE_WIDGETS` controls ChatGPT Apps iframe usage.

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `full` | Default. Widget UI is attached to exposed workspace, file, edit, and shell tools. |
| `changes` | Enables the aggregate `show_changes` tool and attaches widget UI to `open_workspace` and `show_changes`. |
| `off` | Disables widget UI. |

## Skills

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `DEVSPACE_SKILLS` | Set to `0` to hide skills. Enabled by default. |
| `DEVSPACE_SUBAGENTS` | Set to `1` to expose configured agent profiles as Subagents. Experimental and disabled by default. |
| `DEVSPACE_AGENT_DIR` | Defaults to `~/.codex`; its `skills` child is loaded for compatibility. |
| `DEVSPACE_SKILL_PATHS` | Optional comma-separated additional skill directories. |

DevSpace discovers standard Agent Skills from:

- `~/.agents/skills`
- project `.agents/skills`
- `~/.devspace/skills`

It also keeps compatibility with:

- the bundled `subagent-delegation` skill when `DEVSPACE_SUBAGENTS=1`, unless `~/.devspace/skills/subagent-delegation/SKILL.md` exists
- `DEVSPACE_AGENT_DIR/skills`, defaulting to `~/.codex/skills`
- additional paths from `DEVSPACE_SKILL_PATHS`

When Subagents are enabled, DevSpace discovers agent profiles
from:

- `~/.devspace/agents/*.md`
- project `.devspace/agents/*.md`

`open_workspace` returns a compact catalog containing profile names,
descriptions, providers, and optional models/thinking levels so the host model can choose an
agent without reading provider-specific launch details. `devspace agents ls`
lists existing subagent sessions for the current workspace, scoped by the
workspace environment injected into shell commands. The `subagent-delegation`
skill teaches the model to use only the minimal `devspace agents ls`,
`devspace agents run`, and `devspace agents show` workflow.

Starter profile templates are available under `examples/agents/`. Copy or adapt
them into one of the active profile directories before use.

Legacy project paths such as `.pi/skills` can be added through `DEVSPACE_SKILL_PATHS` when needed.

Example:

```bash
DEVSPACE_SKILL_PATHS="$HOME/.claude/skills,$HOME/company/skills" \
npx @waishnav/devspace serve
```

## Logging

| Variable | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `DEVSPACE_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` |
| `DEVSPACE_LOG_FORMAT` | `json` |
| `DEVSPACE_LOG_FILE` | `1` |
| `DEVSPACE_LOG_FILE_PATH` | `<stateDir>/logs/devspace.jsonl` |
| `DEVSPACE_LOG_CONSOLE_JSON` | `0` |
| `DEVSPACE_LOG_REQUESTS` | `1` |
| `DEVSPACE_LOG_ASSETS` | `0` |
| `DEVSPACE_LOG_TOOL_CALLS` | `1` |
| `DEVSPACE_LOG_SHELL_COMMANDS` | `0` |
| `DEVSPACE_TRUST_PROXY` | `0` |

Set `DEVSPACE_LOG_FORMAT=pretty` for local debugging when
`DEVSPACE_LOG_CONSOLE_JSON=1`.

Logs are written as JSONL by default to `DEVSPACE_LOG_FILE_PATH`. Console output
is intentionally compact and uses this fixed-column format:
`time | workspace | kind | tool | status | duration | details`.

Tool calls are shown in compact form. HTTP requests are shown in compact form
when the path is `/mcp`, the status is `400` or higher, or the request takes at
least 1000ms. Other JSON events remain in the JSONL file and are hidden from the
console unless `DEVSPACE_LOG_CONSOLE_JSON=1` is set.

Second-level durations are highlighted yellow when the terminal supports ANSI
colors, while failed tool lines and HTTP `4xx`/`5xx` lines are highlighted red.
Set `NO_COLOR=1` to disable colors.

## Env-Only Example

```bash
DEVSPACE_OAUTH_OWNER_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -base64 32)" \
DEVSPACE_ALLOWED_ROOTS="$HOME/personal,$HOME/work" \
DEVSPACE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL="https://devspace.example.com" \
DEVSPACE_WORKTREE_ROOT="$HOME/.devspace/worktrees" \
DEVSPACE_TOOL_MODE="minimal" \
DEVSPACE_WIDGETS="full" \
npx @waishnav/devspace serve
```

The environment assignments must be part of the same command invocation, or
exported first.
