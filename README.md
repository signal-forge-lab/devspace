**Give ChatGPT a secure connection to your own machine and Turn ChatGPT into Codex**

Workbridge is a self-hosted MCP server that lets ChatGPT read, edit, search, and run code in your real local projects — your files, your tools, your terminal — without uploading anything to a third party. You run it on your machine, expose it through a tunnel you control, and approve the connection with a password only you have.

## Installation

Workbridge requires Node `>=22.19 <27`.

Install the Workbridge CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @waishnav/devspace
```

Then initialize and start the server:

```bash
workbridge init
workbridge serve
```

Or run it without a global install:

```bash
npx @waishnav/devspace init
npx @waishnav/devspace serve
```

During setup, Workbridge asks for:

- the local project folders ChatGPT is allowed to open through Workbridge
- the local port, usually `7676`
- your public HTTPS base URL from Cloudflare Tunnel, ngrok, Pinggy, Tailscale Funnel, or
  another reverse proxy

Use the public origin without `/mcp` during setup:

```text
https://your-tunnel-host.example.com
```

You will configure your MCP client with the public `/mcp` URL after setup.

When the client connects, Workbridge opens an Owner password approval page. Enter
the Owner password printed by `workbridge init`. It is also stored in:

```text
~/.devspace/auth.json
```

Keep that password private.

## Connect Your MCP Client

The default local endpoint is:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:7676/mcp
```

Most users should connect through a public HTTPS tunnel:

```text
https://your-tunnel-host.example.com/mcp
```

> [!NOTE]
> Using Workbridge as an MCP connector isn't against OpenAI's Usage Policies — it's
> a standard custom App/connector setup, and writing or running code isn't a
> restricted use case. But your account is governed by your usage, not by
> Workbridge. Don't point it at anything that would violate your provider's terms.
> Used normally, you're fine. (Based on OpenAI's Usage Policies and Service Terms

## What ChatGPT Can Do

Once connected, ChatGPT can open one of your approved project folders as a
workspace. From there, it can inspect the repo, make scoped edits, run commands,
and show you what changed.

Workbridge gives ChatGPT tools to:

- write and edit files inside the opened workspace
- collect Git, package, instruction, and file-list context with `workspace_snapshot`
- inspect known file ranges with `create_workspace_index` and `read_index_ranges`
- use direct `read` / `read_many` only when `DEVSPACE_ENABLE_LEGACY_READ_TOOLS=1`
- use `edit_many` only when `DEVSPACE_ENABLE_EDIT_MANY=1`
- use dedicated Git workflow tools for status, staging, commits, and exact hunk staging
- search code and inspect directories
- run shell commands for tests, builds, git, and package scripts
- use isolated Git worktrees for parallel coding sessions
- follow project instructions from `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`
- discover local agent skills from your skill folders
- show tool cards and optional change summaries in ChatGPT Apps-compatible hosts

## Mental Model

Workbridge is remote access to selected local folders.

You decide which roots are allowed. The MCP client still has powerful local
capabilities inside an opened workspace, including shell execution. Treat a
connected client like a trusted coding partner with access to your machine.

For a normal ChatGPT coding session:

1. Start your tunnel.
2. Run `workbridge serve`.
3. Connect the MCP client to your public `/mcp` URL.
4. Approve the connection with the Owner password.
5. Ask ChatGPT to open a project inside one of your allowed roots.

For fewer MCP round trips at the start of a coding task, clients can use:

```text
open_workspace
workspace_snapshot
create_workspace_index
read_index_ranges
```

`workspace_snapshot` performs a bounded, read-only repository survey. Indexed
range reads keep known-file inspection compact. Legacy direct read tools and
`edit_many` are hidden by default behind env flags. Dedicated Git tools cover
status, recent commits, whole-file staging, whole-file commits, staged
commits, and exact text hunk staging without shell command construction.

## Platform Support

Workbridge supports Linux, macOS, and Windows environments with a Bash-compatible
shell.

Optional shell helpers such as `rg`, `fd`, `jq`, and `yq` can make MCP-driven
inspection faster and more predictable in minimal tool mode. They are not npm
dependencies of Workbridge; install them on the machine that runs Workbridge and
restart the terminal before restarting `workbridge serve`.

| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Linux                                             | Supported         | Requires Node, npm, Git, and Bash.             |
| macOS                                             | Supported         | Requires Node, npm, Git, and Bash.             |
| Windows with Git Bash, WSL, MSYS2, or Cygwin Bash | Supported         | Git Bash is the simplest native Windows setup. |
| Windows PowerShell or `cmd.exe` only              | Not supported yet | Install Git Bash or use WSL.                   |

Run this to inspect your local setup:

```bash
workbridge doctor
```

## Philosophy

Every piece of software is becoming conversational. Natural language is
redefining how we interact with tools, workflows, and systems.

My bet is that ChatGPT becomes the operating system for everything. Once we
reach AGI, we will simply talk to ChatGPT, and it will prompt, coordinate, and
orchestrate sub-agents that set up the right loops for us.

We are not there yet.

Workbridge is one attempt to fast-forward that future: a way for MCP-capable
hosts like ChatGPT and Claude to work directly with local project files through
explicit, inspectable tools.

## Built by Waishnav

I'm Waishnav, I like building opinionated products and tools, and Workbridge is one example of that.
This year, I started my journey to build a single-person and multiple-agents company doing multiple millions in
revenue. If you want to watch the failures, wins, lessons, and everything in
between, come hang out with me on [X](https://x.com/wshxnv).
